# Disco Programmatic Issuance Demo 🕺🔮

<!-- ### Check out the live demo 👉 [NextJS wagmi](https://nextjs-wagmi.vercel.app/) -->

## Overview
This demo showcases the process of programmatic issuance to a Disco Data Backpack via an Ethereum (ETH) address using Next, React, and Tailwinds CSS.

Users can connect their wallet and click a button to receive a GM Verifiable Credential issued by Disco. 


## How to use this template

### 1. Clone this app
```
git clone https://github.com/discoxyz/programmatic-issuance-demo.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
yarn install
```

### 3. Grab Disco API Key

Self-service API keys are now available to profiles with organization credentials. Steps to generating a key are [here](https://disco.mirror.xyz/8AkcZERU2amKqb5cQj3GLoFDtxDm0uwi-Zp_m5_L5hM).

Add this to .env.local:

```bash
DISCO_API_KEY=<insert api key>
```

### 4. Credential Issuance
In index.ts, replace the following line with the schema URL of your choice. If there is metadata, pass in a `subjectData: {}` JSON object as the third argument to issueCredential.

```javascript
55 const schemaUrl = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/discoxyz/disco-schemas/main/json/GMCredential/1-0-0.json';
```
All schemas can be found here: https://github.com/discoxyz/disco-schemas.

In `discoClient.js`, we are making the request to the Disco API, feel free to modify the request/response logic here.

### 5. Start the local development environment
```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Connect Wallet, and Click Issue GM Credential! Go to [app.disco.xyz](app.disco.xyz) to see the credential in your inbox, almost instantaneously.
